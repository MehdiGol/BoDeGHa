\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

% As an important chapter of my life is about to end, I would like to express my gratitude towards those who directly or indirectly have been part of this four-year journey.

% First and foremost, I would like to thank Tom, my advisor and head of the lab I have been part of this whole time.
% Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with all these technologies I wanted to explore, even though they are outside of your main research interests,  but also for your incredible availability (how many dozens of days do you have in a week?) as well as the swiftness, quantity and quality of your invaluable feedback and guidance along the way; and thank you for letting me borrow your most excellent (immersive?) research kit during the CAMPaM workshop; so, for all these reasons and many more, bedankt!\footnote{Sentence intentionally left long and complex}

% Anis, my second adviser, thank you for providing a context in which I could experiment with immersive technologies. Thank you for helping me benefit from your network of contacts in a field I knew nothing about, but also for turning your students into ``guinea pigs'' to test our prototypes and for accompanying me to these conferences and seminars.

% Thank you as well to all jury and ``comité d'accompagnement'' members, for accepting to review my work and provide valuable feedback on it. Your comments and suggestions helped make this dissertation better.
% More specifically, thank you Annie for inviting me at LIST during these 3 months by combating the sanitary situation. Thank you Gilles for the discussions we had at various events, and for showing me that hybrid specimens in between computer scientists and architects do exist. ACK to you Bruno, for providing the external view on my work and for giving me an excuse to talk about technical details.

% ``Merci'' (in Luxembourgish) to Nico, Elie, Sylvain, Calin and the people at LIST, for welcoming me in your office in order to collaborate on that prototype.

% Thank you to all the colleagues I met during this time, and to the multiple co-workers I had the pleasure to share an office with. I would likely forget some of you so I would rather keep it generic but you all helped make our work environment such a nice and pleasant place.

% Thank you to Robin, for choosing to work on my student project proposal, and for carrying it out nicely so that it contributed to the present dissertation.
% Thank you to all the ``guinea pigs'' that tried various versions of our prototypes and provided feedback on them, and to all survey respondents for their valuable time.

% Thank you to Ivan Sutherland, for inspiring and pioneering both head-mounted displays and computer-aided design. As a nod to your research achievements and how their combination matches the subject of this dissertation, each chapter starts with an epigraph with quotes from you that felt appropriate.

% On a more personal level, thank you to all my tennis and padel partners, hitting the ball with you allowed me to exert myself and helped clear my mind from all those 0's and 1's. Thank you to my friends, for providing all those relaxing and enjoyable times.
% Thank you to my family for your unwavering support during these four years but also since I was born.

% Finally, thank you to all the ``et al.'' that I may have forgotten.















%This period of my life is now ending and there are several people to whom I am grateful. 
%
%First, I would like to thank Jef, my supervisor and truthfully a guide during these four years.
%Thank you for your advice, your time, and your patience. Thank you for your unyielding help,
%we both know I needed it. Some people are a crucial influence on a person's life, I know you
%are one for me. Thank you for giving me the chance to experience all of this, it was amazing.
%I was really lucky to have you as my advisor.
%
%Thanks to Meghyn Bienvenu, Véronique Bruyère, Alexandre Decan, Floris Geerts and Olivier Kauffman who
%took part of their time and accepted to be members of my jury.
%
%The learning and working environment at the UMONS is wonderful and I am thankful to have had the possibility
%of experiencing it. Thanks to the Secretariat department, always glad to help me, from the first day nine
%years ago, in particular Claudia. 
%Thanks to the professors, who took their time to answer my questions, even when I was no longer a
%student; a particular thanks to Christophe Troestler, whom I believed nine years ago was an infinite source of knowledge and now I am convinced. Thanks also to Thomas Brihaye, each five minutes talk with you made
%my day a little brighter.
%
%I would like to thank my friends and colleagues, research is more fun when you have people you can complain to.
%Thank you Maximilien, the best bureau partner would have been a clone of me, but you are the next best thing
%surely; I almost made a tiny house because of you.
%Thank you Marion for introducing me to Kaamelott and board games, now I am stuck with you as a friend for life;
%knowing you is in my top $10^{100}$ experiences in life, guessing the exact number is up to you.
%Thank you Aline, we have walked almost the same academic path, 
%talking to you have this pleasant feeling of talking to an old friend of fifty years, which is weird because 
%we have known each other for only nine.
%Thank you Clément and Pierre for letting me interrupt your work practically every day, with the time 
%I passed in your bureau I almost deserve a chair there; Pierre I hope you know I always let you win in chess.
%Thank you Jeremy and David, tweaking a Linux distribution is a child's play now. 
%Thank you Adrian, watching Roland Garros once was all it took to love tennis.
%
%Thank you Danny and Samuel, with our talks I'm now sure that loving science is for life.
%
%Thanks to my family, that is bigger than they imagine, as my life partner's family is also mine. I am 
%blessed to have so many good-natured people around me. 
%Thanks to my step-mother, who cares for me more than
%I could have ever imagined. 
%Thanks to my father-in-law, for all of his advice and his immeasurable help,
%a great part of my present happiness is thanks to him.
%Thanks to my fathers.
%Thanks to my mother, you are figuratively and literally the reason I am here; you are more stressed than
%I am with this work, but everything should be fine.
%
%Last, I would like to thank my partner in life, thank you Justine.
%Merci, il y a plus de lumière dans ma vie que je n'aurais jamais crue possible grâce à toi.
%Pour la stabilité actuelle dans ma vie, le mérite te revient à toi seule. Merci d'avoir su
%garder mes pieds sur terre, tu me fais tellement de bien et tu ne le sais même pas. Merci pour
%ta patience et ton support, cette thèse est ton travail autant que le mien (peut-être plus le mien
%quand même). Je t'aime.
